## Installation
* Clone the repo
* In R:
  `source("path/to/repo/tools.r")`
  `source("path/to/repo/common.r")`
  For each library that does not exist, you will have to `install.package("offending_library")`
* Have a look at the code but the main usefull tools are `blpConnect`, `bbdh` for historical data, and `regress` for regression charting.
* There is a bunch of other linear algebra stuff in there specifically PCA-related, and also convenience functions like `logret`.
